	<strong>Today is the Spitak Earthquake Remembrance Day which honors the memory of the victims of the earthquake that occurred on 7 December 1988.

Two cities were completely destroyed, 19 towns and 324 villages were greatly affected.</strong></div>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em>A feature film about the disaster &quot;Earthquake&quot; was released recently. Our staff member, Ashot Sargsyan, shared with us his story of how the earthquake changed his life, why we must remember Spitak and what he thinks about the new movie.</em></p>
<div>
	<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	<strong><strong>About that day </strong></strong></div>
<div>
	<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	It was a normal winter day in Spitak: children were at school, adults &ndash; at work, hundreds of people were doing shopping, older people stayed at home. Around 11.30 am I looked at my watch and reminded colleagues that we should soon grab something to eat. I was in Yerevan, at my beloved science center at the Polytechnic Institute. All of a sudden there was a strong jolt and our old building, which was built after the war, jumped and began bouncing. We immediately ran outside from the third floor. It was hard to believe that it was an earthquake. We were joking and laughing. I still remember how it occurred to me that earthquakes may trigger fires so I rushed back upstairs and turned off all electricity.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The grass outside was still green, the weather had no semblance to winter and we somehow had a lot of fun. It was probably out of fear.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Only four hours or so later did we find out what really happened. However, rumors began to spread much earlier, &quot;Spitak has been wiped off the face of the Earth&hellip;Leninakan&hellip;half of Armenia.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	<strong><strong>First week</strong></strong></div>
<div>
	<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	Me and my friends immediately gathered, put everything we could in a car and went to Leninakan (today, Gyumri). Many more people did the same &ndash; organizations dispatched their entire staff to help.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Then, there was a terribly cold week in Leninakan with short winter days that piled into a long, endless, and full of bottomless sorrow week of helpless swarming in the ruins. We lived in tents; in this cold weather sleeping was not an option.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Our primary task was to clean up the rubble. But one day we managed to take out from under the ruins a young woman though she had to have her leg urgently amputated to avoid blood poisoning. There was also a baby boy who, as it turned out, was not even a year old. He was under the rubble but suffered no injury at all.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The scale of the destruction was so great, coordination in the field so spontaneous that massive human losses were unavoidable. &nbsp;Nevertheless, people worked tirelessly rescuing victims with bare hands, working at night in the dark or using flashlights. What with proper equipment and expertise could be done in minutes, took hours and even days.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	It was hard physically, but the hardest thing was to live in frozen time, where the clock showed the same time, where the present had nothing to do with the warm coffee on the stove, where people were swarming in the rubble in hopes to find a window into the world that was gone forever, to touch loved ones once again, to reach a familiar corner in the room. Where one would desperately hold on to a three-liter jar of peach compote prepared for the winter only three months ago. Recovered from the ruins intact, the jar was the only thing remaining from that previous life. No one is crying anymore, there are no tears left. Monotonous moaning filling the air. It was hard to understand where it came.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This is how I remember Leninakan in the early days after the earthquake.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	<strong><strong>Help from around the globe</strong></strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Later professional rescue teams from different countries began to arrive. The Soviet Union, already cracking at the seams, opened its borders after the earthquake in Spitak. Chernobyl was two years earlier but then there was no communication with the outside world. Spitak earthquake was different as the border was opened literally on the second day. For the first time we saw so many foreigners on Soviet soil at once.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	A foreign intervention was unfolding in front of our eyes, an intervention we had feared so much. Except it was a humanitarian intervention with people coming to help from 113 countries &ndash; that is, around 40,000 volunteers and professionals. Aircrafts were arriving from everywhere.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Amidst cold ruins and neatly stacked piles of coffins, great brotherhood was conceived which was destined to survive the collapse of the USSR and the subsequent turmoil in our country and around the world. We were united by a great sorrow as if wrapped in hands stretching out for our help.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Still today if you drive around the disaster area, you will see former construction sites with inscriptions on the old metal gates indicating the country that set up their base there: &ldquo;Kazakhstroy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Uzbekstroy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ukrstroy.&rdquo; You would see homes, schools and hospitals built by the Italians, the Swiss, the Austrians, the Germans, the Russians and many others.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	<strong><strong>How the Spitak earthquake changed the world</strong></strong></div>
<div>
	<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	The Spitak earthquake taught the international community several lessons. The Soviet Union began to form professional rescue teams and purchase special equipment. Such first rescue unit &ldquo;Spitak&rdquo; was established in Armenia with the support of the German Red Cross. The experience of &quot;Spitak&quot; was then replicated by many other groups in the USSR.</div>
<div>
	Spitak earthquake also showed the importance of coordinating aid with other organizations, businesses and individuals, and not just simply giving out aid. It is not enough to give one&rsquo;s last piece of bread to the needy, we must also know whether he needs it now? Maybe medicines or food would be more appropriate at the moment?</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	An attempt to respond to these questions was the adoption by the UN General Assembly resolution 46/182 in 1991, the result of which was an organization where I work today &ndash; the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Simply put, OCHA. This year and in this month, we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of OCHA.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Our mission is to ensure the delivery and distribution of humanitarian assistance from hundreds and thousands of professional humanitarian organizations among the most affected and vulnerable quickly and per their needs.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Among our achievements I want to emphasize the creation of an international search and rescue advisory group (INSARAG) with its main aim to develop more effective international search and rescue procedures and operational standards following major earthquakes. It is no coincidence that the Armenian search and rescue team was the first in the region to get classified according to the international standards established by INSARAG. Kazakhstan is also on its way to reach the same classification, and similar initiatives are ongoing in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Georgia. Following such successful classification, rescuers from this region can deploy on search and rescue operations anywhere in the world.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Today, international search and rescue teams arrive within 6-12 hours to a disaster area and immediately begin to work. There are certain rules by which they operate and established coordination mechanisms.</div>
<div>
	<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	<strong><strong>Earthquakes do not kill people, buildings do </strong></strong></div>
<div>
	<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	Unfortunately, the lessons of Spitak are gradually dissipating. It is understandable that as time passes young people know less or nothing at all about the tragedy. Maybe the new film &quot;Earthquake&quot; will serve as a reminder for many, but personally I am not going to watch it. Those who survived this tragedy will never be able to forget it.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	We must not only remember the Spitak earthquake but also apply its lessons. In our region &ndash; both in the Caucasus and in Central Asia &ndash; seismic risks are among the highest in the world.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	In pursuit of daily concerns, it is easy to forget that we are guests of the nature and must know and abide by its rules. This goes beyond environmental protection down to basic things &ndash; how to behave in disasters, how to put in place normative security and undertake structural measures.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	We have a notion of &quot;the Leninakan nine-story buildings&quot; &ndash; these were a series of identical houses that turned into concrete dust during the Spitak earthquake. Follow-up investigations looked into why there were so many victims and whether it was possible to avoid the losses. There were conversations about the unique nature of the earthquake, which combined vertical and horizontal tremors. Nevertheless, the main reason, as it turned out, had to do with people. First, seismic regulations were underreported, that is, the houses were designed for smaller-scale earthquake. Second, of course, is the quality. In the former Soviet Union, construction was the &ldquo;fattest&rdquo; place, and systemic theft knew no bounds.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Now I want you to picture waking up tonight from the sound of dishes clattering in the kitchen, walls shaking. The first wave of an earthquake. Do you know what to do, where to go? Let&rsquo;s say that even though it is not recommended to run out outside, you still try but the door is jammed. You have little time and need to ensure maximum safety. The bearing wall. Does your apartment have it or did it lose it during renovation? Is there a window nearby? Is there a risk to cut yourself on the broken glass? Is the wardrobe at risk of falling? Where is your phone (and is it charged?), documents, is there water and food enoughfor the first few days of the worst-case scenario? And this is far from an exhaustive list of questions that you should have the answer to.</div>
<div>
	<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	<strong><strong>So what can we do today?</strong></strong></div>
<div>
	<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	Most importantly, we need to forget the notion of a &ldquo;natural disaster&rdquo;. There are natural hazards: floods, earthquakes, storms, that can become disasters and catastrophes. A disaster occurs when people live in risk areas, thinking that they are insured against potential losses. A disaster happens when lessons learned from the past are forgotten and are not passed on from generation to generation. We cannot predict when the next earthquake will occur but we can implement measures that tomorrow will alleviate our suffering if the worst happens.</div>
<div>
	<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	Some of these measures include the following:</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get basic knowledge about how to behave in situations for one&rsquo;s wellbeing. There is a lot of information online. You can contact the local branch of Red Cross or Red Crescent Society. They always have leaflets, instructors and necessary materials.</div>
<div>
	2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you come home today, take a look around your apartment, your home. In case of earth moving, where is potential hazard? Thick books on a shelf? Cupboard in the living room? Flower pots? Glass dining table? According to expert assessments, about a half of earthquake victims die in their own homes due to heavy items falling on them: shelves, cupboards.</div>
<div>
	3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put together or purchase a so called emergency kit with the most important items and documents. As far as I know, the Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies also have such kits.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Last &ndash; <strong>talk to your family and relatives</strong>. And not just tonight. Regularly. In order to withstand shocks tomorrow, you have to develop the culture of preparedness today and all the time. Every household needs to have a family plan and an emergency kit. Homes must be furnished according to seismic guidelines. Your children must know how to behave in emergencies when you are not around. We should not be afraid of these conversations. A massive disaster may not occur in decades but the level of preparedness of your children and grandchildren tomorrow depends on you and me today, it depends on our decisions and actions.</div>
